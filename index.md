Hi there, I'm Jacek, a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I worked on Windows, was a staff member at Microsoft Research. Currently, I'm working on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/tools-for-software-engineers/">Microsoft's engineering system</a>.

I am interested in the engineering process and tooling but in particular all aspects of verification e.g. 
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.1145&rep=rep1&type=pdf">testing</a>, 
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/PID3556473.pdf">code reviewing</a>,
security,
policy and compliance.

I like to look at engineering practices through <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6509369/">data</a> and attemtping to find what makes engineers <a href="http://chisel.cs.uvic.ca/pubs/storey-TSE2019.pdf">productive and happy</a>.

While my day job is in engineering, I and my team try to publish an occasional paper. I have been (in some cases still am) on program committees of several conferences: ICSE SEIP, ISSRE, ICPC, IWCT, and SANER.

### Some of my more notable publications
* My work on <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.1145&rep=rep1&type=pdf">combinatorial testing</a>, older but still very relevant stuff.
* A combinatorial test generation tool. Open source on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pict">GitHub</a>.
* Why code reviewing is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/PID3556473.pdf">more complicated</a> than we assume and even more so on <a href="https://www.michaelagreiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Code-Reviewing-in-the-Trenches-Understanding-Challenges-Best-Practices-and-Tool-Needs.pdf">large projects</a>.
* How <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6509369/">collecting engineering process data</a> is done at scale and what we <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124115194000136"> do with it</a> once we have it.             
* How to <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2591176">predict which parts of code</a> will be the most problematic.
* Initial work on <a href="http://chisel.cs.uvic.ca/pubs/storey-TSE2019.pdf">engineering productivity</a>.

### My other stuff
* <a href="http://www.pairwise.org">Webpage</a> on combinatorial testing that I maintain.
* Me  on <a href="https://www.github.com/jaccz">GitHub</a>.
* <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-Rt0AgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Google Scholar</a> keeps track of my publications.
* <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacekcz/">LinkedIn</a> has the rest.

        Hi there, I'm Jacek, a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I worked on Windows, was a staff member at Microsoft Research. Currently, I'm working on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/tools-for-software-engineers/">Microsoft's engineering system</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am interested in the engineering process and tooling but in particular all aspects of verification e.g. 
        <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.1145&rep=rep1&type=pdf">testing</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/PID3556473.pdf">code reviewing</a>,
        security,
        policy and compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like to look at engineering practices through <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6509369/">data</a> and attemtping to find what makes engineers <a href="http://chisel.cs.uvic.ca/pubs/storey-TSE2019.pdf">productive and happy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        While my day job is in engineering, I and my team try to publish an occasional paper. I have been (in some cases still am) on program committees of several conferences: ICSE SEIP, ISSRE, ICPC, IWCT, and SANER.

            Why code reviewing is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/PID3556473.pdf">more complicated</a> than we assume and even more so on <a href="https://www.michaelagreiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Code-Reviewing-in-the-Trenches-Understanding-Challenges-Best-Practices-and-Tool-Needs.pdf">large projects</a>.
